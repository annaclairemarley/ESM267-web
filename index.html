<h1>Seaweed Aquaculture Area Needed to Mitigate Gulf Of Mexico Hypoxic Zone</h1>
<p> Seaweed is a natural bioextractant, and when grown in aquaculture, could be an effective tool for reducing nutrient pollution in hypoxic zones, such as in the Gulf of Mexico.
 This map displays how large of an area would need to be farmed in the Gulf to reduce the hypoxic zone by 20%, the goal set by the Hypoxia Task Force. Two different types of targeted
seaweeds for farming are displayed, Eucheuma and Sargassum, with the June hypoxic zone extent shown for size reference. </p>
